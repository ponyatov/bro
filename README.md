This is a collection of embedded Linux jigs powered by Buildroot build system.
This toolset expands the base Buildroot with many packages and additional 
configs for ARM/MIPS control boards I use, and some software used in my projects. 

Some of them are commercial and covered by contracts and NDA, but most parts 
were publicated for coworking and improvements by a community 
(if you want to share and contribute).
